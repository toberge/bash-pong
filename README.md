# Singleplayer Pong written in bash

![demo](demo.svg)

## Usage

Clone the repo, `cd` into it, then simply run

```sh
./pong.sh
```

## Acknowledgements

+ Yes, this is not a faithful Pong clone.
+ It was written as an exercise in actually doing "graphics" from a shell script. It is far from perfect.
